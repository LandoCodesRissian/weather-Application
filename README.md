# Weather App Readme

## Introduction

This weather application is a web-based tool that allows users to search for the current weather and a 5-day forecast for a city of their choice. It fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the web page. Users can also view their search history and click on previous searches to quickly check the weather for those cities.

## Features

- **5-Day Forecast:** Users can view a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city. The forecast includes the high temperature for each day.

- **Search History:** The application keeps track of previous city searches and displays them as a clickable list. Users can click on a previous search to quickly retrieve weather information for that city.

## Usage
